Since Harry's launch in 2013, it has lit up the ecommerce market for men's care products. The next logical step was taking that idea to another market – shaving products for women – with the launch of Flamingo. The site went live in October 2018 with thousands of users visiting the new website and hundreds of thousands of page views in the first week. The launch triggered the need for an optimized website with performance built-in, which was delivered seamlessly by Gatsby. It also carried a surprising internal reward – Harry’s and Flamingo developers are re-engaged about learning, charging into the future of modern website development and performance on the edge.
